<h1>Level9</h1>
Level9 is an interpreter for the games by the English text adventure company Level 9. These
games received considerable critical acclaim at the time and are probably the best text
adventures written for the small cassette based 8-bit computers common in Britain during the
early to mid 1980s.
<p>
The Level9 interpreter was originally written by Glen Summers, and later extended by myself,
along with Alan Staniforth, Simon Baldwin, Dieter Baron and Andreas Scherrer. It has the very
useful ability to search for Level 9 game data in any file loaded into it, allowing it to find
games in uncompressed memory dumps from emulators (such as the commonly used Spectrum emulator
SNA file format). Both the line-drawn graphics used in a number of Level 9's ealier games and
the bitmap graphics from later games are also supported.

The current version is available from
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Level9/releases/">Level9's GitHub release</a> page.
Ports to systems other than Windows are available from the IF-Archive, in the 
<a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/level9/interpreters/level9/">Level9 interpreter</a>
section.

Here are two screenshots of the interpreter in action: first Red Moon, and then Lords of Time.
