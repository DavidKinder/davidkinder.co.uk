a bit more than there used to be...</p>

<h2>Text Adventures</h2>

Text adventures, or "interactive fiction", are text-based computer games. If you were playing computer
games in the late 1970s or 1980s, you might remember games like this (the start of Infocom's Zork):
<pre><blockquote>
ZORK I: The Great Underground Empire
Infocom interactive fiction - a fantasy story
Copyright (c) 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 Infocom, Inc.
All rights reserved.
ZORK is a registered trademark of Infocom, Inc.
Release 52 / Serial number 871125 / Interpreter 4 Version F

West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.

Commercial text adventures are long gone, but there is an active community writing freely available
games, based around the
<a href="https://www.intfiction.org/forum/">intfiction.org Forum</a>, the blogs collected at
<a href="https://planet-if.com/">Planet IF</a>, and the
<a href="https://www.ifarchive.org/">Interactive Fiction Archive</a>, which contains much of the
community's work. If you're looking for somewhere to start making sense of all the games and systems
in the IF-Archive, try <a href="https://ifdb.tads.org/">The Interactive Fiction Database</a>.
<p>
Most of these games are written in various well defined formats, for which interpreters are
built for various operating systems. To play, all you need to do is start the relevant interpreter
for your computer, then load in the game you want to play. The following are the interpreters
I've been involved with:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="frotz.html">Windows Frotz</a>, for Z-code (Infocom) games.
</li><li><a href="glulxe.html">Windows Glulxe and Windows Git</a>, both for Glulx games.
</li><li><a href="agility.html">Windows AGiliTy</a>, for AGT games.
</li><li><a href="magnetic.html">Magnetic</a>, for games written by Magnetic Scrolls.
</li><li><a href="level9.html">Level9</a>, for games written by Level 9.
</li></ul>
I'm also part of the team behind <a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a>, a user-friendly design
system for writing text adventures.<p>
If you want access to the bleeding-edge source code for these projects, I use GitHub for source code
control: <a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/">https://github.com/DavidKinder/</a>.
</p><h2>Ancient Software</h2>
In the computer world "old" is anything not made this year, so "ancient" in this context means
from the 1980s. Below are several old software packages I've worked on resurrecting for modern
systems:
<ul>
<li><a href="abermud.html">AberMUD II</a>, one of the first MUDs (a multi-user text adventure, effectively).
</li><li><a href="dbw.html">DBW-Render</a>, an early ray tracing graphics package.
</li><li><a href="omega.html">Omega</a>, a game inspired by Rogue and the Ultima series.
</li><li><a href="xlife.html">Xlife</a>, an implementation of John Conway's "Life" cellular automata,
optimized for very large patterns.
</li><li>A <a href="c64_mine.zip">collection</a> of games and utilities written by me for the Commodore 64,
the first computer I ever owned.
</li><li>Commodore 64 emulator tape images of the <a href="c64_zzap.zip">Zzap!64 Sampler Tape</a>, which came
with issue 26 of the UK magazine "Zzap! 64". This doesn't seem to be available anywhere else. For an
emulator, I would recommend <a href="https://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/">VICE</a>.
</li></ul>
