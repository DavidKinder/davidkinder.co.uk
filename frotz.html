<h1>Windows Frotz</h1>
Windows Frotz is an interpreter that can play all the old Infocom text adventures. Infocom used
a novel approach to write their games: they had a system that produced a data file for the adventure
that was the same on every computer, and an interpreter for every computer that could run all the
games (It was actually a bit more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea).
<p>
During the late 1980s and early 1990s many people worked to decode Infocom's format, producing
several interpreters for the format (which is called Z-code, or the Z-Machine, with the Z coming
from Zork, Infocom's first game). Windows Frotz is the latest in this line of interpreters.
During the early 1990s, Graham Nelson took the next step by writing a compiler for the format,
called <a href="https://www.inform-fiction.org/">Inform</a>. The result is that the modern text
adventure community have written several hundred games in this format that can be played with this
interpreter.
<p>
The current version is available from
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Frotz/releases/">Windows Frotz's GitHub release</a>
page. For ratings and descriptions of games you can play,

<p>
Frotz supports
<a href="https://babel.ifarchive.org/">The Treaty of Babel</a>, and can read game metadata in the iFiction
format defined by the treaty. For an example of this, you can download a copy of Graham Nelson's
<a href="curses.zblorb">Curses</a>, packaged as a Blorb file with metadata and cover art.

Here are two screenshots of the interpreter in action: first Emily Short's Savoir-Faire,
and then Infocom's Zork Zero.
