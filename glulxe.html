<h1>Windows Glulxe and Windows Git</h1>
Windows Glulxe is an interpreter for text adventures in the
<a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/glulx/index.html">Glulx</a> format.
which is a format designed by Andrew Plotkin to move beyond the <b>Z-code</b>
format supported by
<a href="frotz.html">Windows Frotz</a>.
Glulx removes all the size limitations of Z-code, and has a more powerful input and
output model, supporting graphics and sounds in various formats. Like Z-code, the
standard way of writing a Glulx adventure game is with Graham Nelson's
<a href="http://www.inform7.com/">Inform</a> compiler.
<p>
The current version is available from
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Glulxe/releases/">Windows Glulxe's GitHub release</a> page.

Here are two screenshots of the interpreter in action: first Emily Short's Counterfeit Monkey,
and then Adam Cadre's Narcolepsy.

<p>
Also available is a Windows port of a faster Glulx interpreter, called Git. This uses the same Windows I/O
layer as Windows Glulxe, so it looks the same, but it plays games up to five times faster.
The current version is available from
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Git/releases/">Windows Git's GitHub release</a> page.
<p>
If you're of a programming inclination, you may also be interested in the I/O layer of Windows Glulxe,
called <b>Windows Glk</b>. This is an implementation of Andrew's
<a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/glk/index.html">Glk</a> specification,
which is an attempt to define a library interface that can be used for any text
adventure style program. Windows Glk is available from
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Glk/">its GitHub page</a>.
