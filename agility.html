<h1>Windows AGiliTy</h1>
Windows AGiliTy is an interpreter for the old Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT). Although
considered outdated and little used these days, AGT was popular in the late 1980s,
and a community centered around Compuserve (a commercial bulletin board system
popular before the Internet really took off) wrote a large number of games with it.
Of these games a few are still worth playing, such as <b>Compuserve</b> and
<b>Shades of Gray</b>.
<p>
Windows AGiliTy is a port of Robert Masenten's AGiliTy, a reverse engineered interpreter
that can play games produced with any of the many versions of AGT.
<p>
The current version is available from
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-AGiliTy/releases/">Windows AGiliTy's GitHub release</a> page.
Ports to systems other than Windows are available from the IF-Archive, in the 
<a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/programming/agt/agility/">AGiliTy AGT interpreter</a>
section.
